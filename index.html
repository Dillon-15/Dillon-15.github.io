            <p class="song">[Chorus]: <br>Gimme that God Almighty
            <br>That good ol' Bible
            <br>That old school doctrine (Oh, Lord)
            <br>Gimme that truth for the body
            <br>Ain't nothing new about it
            <br>But it's still full of power (oh, Lord) 
            <br> Now church clap, let me hear the church clap (church clap) (oh, Lord) 
            <br>Church clap, let me hear the church clap (church clap) (oh, Lord)
            <br>Church clap, let me hear the church clap (church clap) (oh, Lord)
            <br>Church clap, let me hear the church clap (oh, Lord)</p>
            <p class="description">In the chorus Im getting that the source of our truth comes from the power of the bible. And with growing up in church there is jsut something fun and exciting about the congregation claping with the songs.</p>
            <p class="song">[Verse #1]: <br>Gimme dat, church mother and they church hat, clap (come on)
            <br>Man that Shug Avery Color Purple comin' back, clap, uh (you gotta say)
            <br>When that whole week beat you up and stress ya (uh)
            <br>But you hear that organ playin', it remind ya of ya blessings (yeah, come oh)
            <br>And on another note, she just hit another note
            <br>Chills down my spine, got me cryin', make me over Lord
            <br>You don't know about us though, old school church hymns (ayy)
            <br>Deacons get to hummin' now the drummer finna burst in (ayy) can you hear me now?
            <br> Church clothes sweaty, you don't care you just get it now (come on)
            <br> Testify, how we made Martyrs outta these Fathers (yeah)
            <br> And rose up all of his daughters to glorify Him with honor
            <br> Now it's flyin' everywhere, she don't care what her head did (yeah)
            <br> She an heir, yeah
            <br> Caught up in the air, yeah
            <br> Probably why she clappin' like Jesus just hear her prayer, yeah (come on)</p>
            <p class="description">In the first verse Im getting that as you go through the week and you get stressed and tired but then sunday comes and you can relax. Also know we are going to be okay and dont have to worry about anything at the time. </p>
            <p class="song">[Verse #2]: <br>I wanna be the type of dude to get the Lord on his feet
            <br>I wanna do the type of shows that the Lord wanna see
            <br> And what I mean (what you mean?) If I could make the whole church clap
            <br> But ain't a clap in the heavens then that clap just a clap, clap (clap)
            <br>(Oh, Lord) for the Son glorified (uh), sin mortified (uh)
            <br>The Holy Spirit's going Word of Truth been watered down (uh)
            <br>It sound doctrine, Spurgeon and common, uh
            <br>Nothing wrong with singing loud but that ain't where the power's at
            <br>For too long the church churches been clappin' at weak sermons (yes)
            <br>Leavin' the weak hurt, no one's changed by Sunday's service (all my life)
            <br>We need discernment, check what you be affirmin'
            <br>'Cause a church can be full of members but empty in conversions (my Lord, ha-ha)
            <br>Preach the gospel (gospel) and stand back (stand back)
            <br>Look for changed lives (uh) not for hand claps (ye-ye-ye)
            <br>Love people well, oh, they can't stand that
            <br>The church just a church when the word is where we stand at</p>
            <p class="description">In verse 2 what Im understanding is that we need to be the kind of person not only to make others happy but to try and make God happy for us. And if we arnt then it is kind of like the word of God is watered down. So we need to preach the gospel and love people.</p>

            <p class="song">[Chorus]: <br>Feels like we're on the edge right now
            <br>I wish that I could say I'm proud
            <br>I'm sorry that I let you down
            <br>I let you down
            <br>All these voices in my head get loud
            <br>I wish that I could shut them out
            <br>I'm sorry that I let you down
            <br>Let you down
            </p>
            <p class="description">In the chorus what Im feeling from this is that when we are feeling completely down and just a that you cant help anyone. And that all we can do is just say sorry for what we have done.</p>
            <p class="song">[Verse #1]: <br>Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment
            Doing everything I can
            <br>I don't wanna make you disappointed
            <br>It's annoying
            <br>I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever did
            <br>Was never tryna make an issue for you
            <br>But I guess the more you thought about everything
            <br>You were never even wrong in the first place, right?
            <br>Yeah, I'ma just ignore you, walking towards you
            <br>With my head down, lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
            <br>Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time? That's parents for you
            <br>Very loyal? Shoulda had my back but you put a knife in it
            <br>My hands are full, what else should I carry for you?
            <br>I cared for you, but</p>
            <p class="description">In verse 1 what I am getting from this is that we might be the disappointment some times and yes we never wanted to be the problem. Sometimes we are going through a bad time and even the poeple we count on arnt there for us or jsut ask us for more from us.</p>
            <p class="song">[Verse #2]: 
            <br>Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
            <br>You just wanna make this worse
            <br>Want me to listen to you
            <br>But you don't ever hear my words
            <br>You don't wanna know my hurt, yet
            <br>Let me guess
            <br>You want an apology, probably
            <br>How can we keep going at a rate like this?
            <br>We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
            <br>Please don't come after me
            <br>I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
            <br>Go ahead, just drink it off
            <br>Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
            <br>Ain't that what you always do?
            <br>I feel like every time I talk to you
            <br>You're in an awful mood
            <br>What else can I offer you?
            <br>There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you
            </p>
            <p class="description">In verse 2 Im getting that even when people are so self centered that they cant see or dont want to help you when you are hurting. And that it is sometimes better to just be alone and try and get your self right when you have nothing let to help with them with.</p>
            <p class="song">[Verse #3]:
            <br>Yeah, don't talk down to me
            <br>That's not gonna work now
            <br>Packed all my clothes and I moved out
            <br>I don't even wanna go to your house
            <br>Everytime I sit on that couch I feel like you lecture me
            <br>Eventually, I bet that we could have made this work
            <br>And probably woulda figured things out
            <br>But I guess I'm a letdown
            <br>But it's cool, I checked out
            <br>Oh, you wanna be friends now?
            <br>Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
            <br>Sit around and talk about the good times
            <br>That didn't even happen
            <br>I mean, why are you laughing?
            <br>Must have missed that joke let me see if I can find a reaction
            <br>No, but at least you're happy
            </p>
            <p class="description">In verse 3 Im feeling that you might need some time away from the people who are not invested to helping in your hard time. And that you can try again in the future but get your self right so you dont have to use a "fake face" as Nate said.</p>

            <p class="song">[Verse #1]: 
            <br>I'll keep swingin' for the fences
            <br>It's like this heart is defenseless
            <br>Against the passion that's pumpin' through my veins
            <br>Blood, sweat, tears, it's a callin'
            <br>And if I can't walk, then I'm crawlin'
            <br>It might flicker, but they can't kill the flame  
            </p>
            <p class="description">In verse 1 Im getting that no matter how hard we fight or get beat down in this world we will always have that flame to keep us going.</p>
            <p class="song">[pre-Chorus]:
              <br>I can't stop, I can't quit
              <br>It's in my heart, it's on my lips
              <br>I can't stop, no, I can't quit
              <br>It's in my heart, yeah, I'm all in
            </p>
            <p class="description">In the pre chorus TobyMac is telling is we cant stop and we must spread the word of God and be all in on this.</p>
            <p class="song">[Chorus]: 
            <br>'Til the wheels fall off
            <br>'Til the spotlight fades
            <br>I will lift Your banner high
            <br>I will lift Your banner high
            <br>And 'til the walls crash in
            <br>For the rest of my days
            <br>I'll lay it all on the line
            <br>'Til the day I
            </p>
            <p class="description">In the Chorus I think TobyMac is trying to tell is that until we die we need to be the spotlight and hold Gods banner up high for God.</p>
            <p class="song">[Post-Chorus]: 
              <br>"Til the day I die
              <br>'Til the end of the line
              <br>('Til the day) 'til the day I die
              <br>It's Your name I'll glorify
            </p>
            <p class="description">In the post Chorus it is just a continuation of the chorus and we need to glorify Gods name until the day we die.</p>
            <p class="song">[Verse #2]: 
            <br>It's runnin' deeper than the ocean
            <br>This ain't religion, it's devotion
            <br>3-6-5, every minute, every day
            <br>So in the middle of the madness
            <br>They can stretch me out like canvas
            <br>But I ain't ever gonna fit in their frame</p>
            <p class="description">In the second verse I feel like it is telling us that it we cant just be a part time christian. That we need to be devoted.</p>
            <p class="song">[Verse #3]: 
            <br>T-T-T-T-T-T-'Til I die and they put me in the coffin (yeah)
            <br>Don't matter if I'm on the road or if I'm recordin'
            <br>Tell me what you think about me, that really ain't important
            <br>You know I'ma represent 'em, I ain't playin', can't afford to
            <br>I only got one life, and I get it though
            <br>And this is not an act, not a movie, not a TV show
            <br>I don't know what "Quittin'" means, I don't ever take it slow
            <br>You know I'm on the grind, me and Toby in the studio
            <br>Do it for the King, what you know about that?
            <br>Say you goin' harder, mmh, I doubt that
            <br>You say you doin' work, but you're asking where the couch at?
            <br>How you doin' work when you asking where the couch at, huh?
            <br>God is not a crutch, you can use Him when you wanna
            <br>You only look to Heaven when you goin' through some drama
            <br>And when they goin' through some problems and that's the only time they call Him
            <br>I guess I don't understand that life, wonder why?
            <br>'Cause' I'm all in
            <br>'Til the day I die</p>
            <p class="description">In verse 3 I getting that we need to not care what some people may say or think of us and live OUR life the way we want. And that we need we can use God in our life help us and others will see that and can see how he is helping in our lives.</p>

            <br>Just fight a little longer my friend
            <br>It's all worth it in the end
            <br>But when you got nobody to turn to
            <br>Just hold on and I'll find you
            <br>I'll find you
            <br>I'll find you
            <br>Just hold on and I'll find you</p>
            <p class="description">In the chorus I feel like Lecrae is tring to get acrossed is that that if you are going though a hard time that someone will be there to help you jsut have to hold on until they are able to help.</p>
            <p class="song">[Verse #1]: 
              <br>I'm hangin' on by a thread
              <br>And all I'm clinging to is prayers
              <br>And every breath is like a battle
              <br>I feel like I ain't come prepared
              <br>And death's knockin' on the front door
              <br>Pain's creepin' through the back
              <br>Fear's crawlin' through the windows
              <br>Waiting for 'em to attack
              <br>They say, "Don't get bitter, get better"
              <br>I'm workin' on switchin' them letters
              <br>But tell God, I'ma need a whole lotta hope keepin' it together
              <br>I'm smilin' in everyone's face
              <br>I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room
              <br>They don't know the battle I face
              <br>They don't understand what I'm goin' through</p>
              <p class="description">In verse 1 Lecrae is telling us to give all your pain and worry and fears to God. As christians we are never going through anything alone.</p>
              <p class="song">[Pre-Chorus]: 
              <br>The world tryna play with my soul
              <br>I'm just tryna find where to go
              <br>I'm tryna remember the way
              <br>I'm tryna get back to my home
              <br>But I can't do this on my own
              <br>That's why I'm just trusting in You
              <br>'Cause I don't know where else to go
              <br>And I don't know what else to do</p>
              <p class="description">In the pre-chorus it is telling us that we are not ever alone and we just need to put our trust in God and believe that He will take care of us in any situation.</p>
              <p class="song">[Verse #2]: 
                <br>Uh, they say, "Fear haunts you
                <br>And pain hates"
                <br>I say, "Pain strengthens
                <br>And fear drives faith"
                <br>And I don't know all of the outcomes
                <br>Don't know what happens tomorrow
                <br>But when that ocean of doubt comes
                <br>Don't let me drown in my sorrow
                <br>And don't let me stay at the bottom
                <br>I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
                <br>I've been lookin' for a way out
                <br>But I'll settle for a peace of mind
                <br>Pickin' up the pieces of my life and hopin' that I put together somethin' right
                <br>Tell me all I got is all I need
                <br>Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight</p>
                <p class="description">In verse 2 Im getting that we need to use our pain and fear to grow our realtionship with God. And even though we dont know how tomorrow will be but what we do know is that God will be with us through what ever happens.</p>
                <p class="song">[Bridge]: 
                <br>No, don't let the fear make you feel like you can't fight this on your own
                <br>You know I, I'll be there for you no matter where you go
                <br>You'll never be alone
